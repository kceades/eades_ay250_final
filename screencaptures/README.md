# Screen Captures

(The following text is also found in the main repo's README under the final project description.)

For the screencapture, I am including screenshots of the website in the repository. If that isn't sufficient, please let me know about a meeting. The screencaptures I included were:
1. The index page
2. The upload CSV page
3. The run scripts page
4. The view results page
5. An example of one of the error pages
6. An example of one of the success pages
7. The results of one of the explained variance queries (note that they all do really well because the model is trained on the data that it is being applied to: see the disclaimers)
8. The results of one of the view components queries
9. One of the gallery pages (that is currently not accessible via the site, but is created when the scripts are run and can be pulled up by going to the directory as detailed on the site)
10. One of my old explained variance curves showing how things get interesting when public models are compared to Factory models and the two are used to fit each other's data (also not accessible via the site, nor created when running these scripts explicitly since I didn't upload the factory data or tool scripts)
